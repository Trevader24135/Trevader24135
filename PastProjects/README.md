# Past Projects

Just simple things like toggling LEDs, and moving memory around. There is nothing complicated hAn archive of older projects that I made a while ago, but I figured were worth mentioning.

        <td>EulerProject</td>
        <td>The website <a href = "https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is a great resource for screwing around with both math and coding, because it has a bunch of mathematics based problems that can be solved through critical thinking and a bit of computer muscle. I like to do problems here and there when I'm bored and want to learn new, interesting mathematical principles.</td>

        <td>"3d printer Gcode singer list.py" & "sendsong.py"</td>
        <td>3D printers are fun, and doubly so when they can be abused in interesting and creative ways. Before I upgraded my stepper motor drivers, my steppers were quite loud. I used their frequency of movement to generate varying pitches and produce music by converting song data into Gcode commands and sending them to the printer, which worked pretty well, but the making the song data was an arduous process.</td>

        <td>"monopoly place finder multithreaded.py"</td>
        <td>This was a response to a video I saw on Numberphile on youtube. They used statistics and programming to find the likelyhood of landing on specific properties and spaces in monopoly, and I thought that that sounded like fun, so I wrote my own program to do the same from scratch. I finally ended up (probably poorly) multithreading it. It works alright, and I learned that far and away "Jail" is the most landed on tile.</td>
