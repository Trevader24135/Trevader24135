# MSP 432 assembly

NOTE: This is currently a very active project, and I am not that good yet. That said, assembly is really fun for me because there is no handholding. I am responsible for every single action that happens on the board and in the memory, and it's just a cool experience. I'll try to document as I go, but again, I'm not great.
