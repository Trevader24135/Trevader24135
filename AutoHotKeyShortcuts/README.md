# My love of AutHotKey

I'll preface this with, yes, I know that autohotkey isn't actually the best thing ever. It's not cross platform, and it could be a major security risk done wrong. That's not including taking the control the mouse and keyboard away from the user, which can always carry risk. However, I just freaking love automating all of the mundane stuff that I find myself always having to deal with for school, math on the computer, electronics, ETC. AutoHotKey shortcuts are a fantastic way for me to quickly and efficiently deal with all these issues. 

In this directory are some of my daily-driver scripts that I let always run on my computer so that I can always have access to Greek characters, mathematical operators, unicode combinators, and more, since AutoHotKey can also interface with the Mouse, not just the keyboard.
