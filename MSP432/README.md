# MSP 432 based projects

These are the projects and learning experiments for my adventures in the use of the TI MSP432 launchpad board. I am especially excited to try to make complex projects in assembly language, but I'll also try refreshing some of my C coding knowledge. Do note that this is one of my latest projects, so there is a lot of learning happening, and I'm far from perfect yet.
