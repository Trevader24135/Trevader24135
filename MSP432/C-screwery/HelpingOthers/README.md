# C - Helping Others

I quite often get asked for help with different assignments and projects from peers. I've decided to keep a copy of what I have helped them with and keep it here.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Project</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CodyStringAsDec</td>
        <td>Cody needed help with his introductory C code. This code simply returns the value of the user-inputted string as-stored in memory.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CodyStringAsAscii</td>
        <td>A continuation of the last code, this code returns the hexadecimal values of the user-inputted string in addition to the decimal. The teacher solution to this problem involved a look-up table of ascii-to-hex values, which is a silly solution because the C printf command already includes conversion of decimal to hex output with the %x and %X string formatting tools.</td>
    </tr>
