# Euler Project with Rust

I like using the website <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">projecteuler.net</a> to learn new programming languages because it presents challenges with a wide variety of required methods and problem types that help me more clearly visualize the quirks and weaknesses of the languages that I learn.
