Hi! I'm Trevor (@Trevader24135)

I am currently studying electrical engineering, but I also have extensive experience programming in a multitude of languages, but I'm most familiar with Python. I love to study other programming languages though, and I've been working more with C lately. I also loved System-Verilog when I learned the basics in one of my classes, and I intend to study it more once I get my hands on my own FPGA dev board.

I am a hobbyist by nature, and love all kinds of technical crafts. I am an Extra class Amateur Radio Operator, and I love all things involved in radio design from the rudimentary knowledge that I have of the intricicies. I also love 3D printing, and designed and built my own 3D printer from scratch, which was and is a blast.
