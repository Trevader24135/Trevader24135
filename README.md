Hi! I'm Trevor (@Trevader24135)

I am currently studying electrical engineering, but I also have extensive experience programming in a multitude of languages, but I'm most familiar with Python. I love to study other programming languages though, and I've been working more with C and JavaScript lately. I also loved System-Verilog when I learned the basics in one of my classes, and I intend to study it more once I get my hands on my own FPGA dev board. I am also known to automate many tasks that I find too menial and too easily automated. As such, I have become quite proficient at AutoHotKey and automating a great many things with simple keybinds and shortcuts.

I am a hobbyist by nature, and love all kinds of technical crafts. I am an Extra class Amateur Radio Operator, and I love all things involved in radio design from the rudimentary knowledge that I have of the intricicies. I also love 3D printing, and designed and built my own 3D printer from scratch, which was and is a blast.

Included here are some of the projects that I have worked on recently, some of which have their own repositories but have been copied here so that I can add some more of my own commentary on what I did in the project, what I learned, and how I would do it differently with what I've learned.

You can enter the repository of my profile to see a compilation of the projects that I have particularly enjoyed and I think serve as good examples of what I am capable of <u>**[here](https://github.com/Trevader24135/Trevader24135)**</u>
